# Ping-Pong-Game

A Javascript based game. It is a smaller and easier version of this game. 

## The main points for the game are -
1. There will be 2 rods at the top and bottom of the screen.
2. Both rods will be controlled with the same keys. In other words, they move together.
3. When the game starts, an alert is shown about the highest score and the player who scored it. If there is no such record, it says 'this is your first time'.
4. After every round, when one wins an alert will be displayed showing the winning player and his score.

## Rules of the game - 
1. Every round starts when the 'Enter' key is pressed. 
2. The rods only move horizontally using the 'a' and 'd' keys in the left and right directions respectively. 
3. The losing rod gets the ball for the next match and the rods and ball then moves to the center.
4. The score is counted from the start of every match.
